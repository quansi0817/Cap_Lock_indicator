# Caps Lock Indicator

## Project Overview
The Caps Lock Indicator is a MacOS application that provides a visual representation of the Caps Lock status directly in the menu bar. When Caps Lock is active, the indicator displays a purple circle (üü£); when inactive, it shows a white circle (‚ö™Ô∏è). This tool is designed to help users easily identify the state of their Caps Lock key without the need for additional software utilities.

## Key Technologies
- **Python**: Main programming language used for developing the application.
- **rumps**: Python library that creates menu bar applications for MacOS.
- **Quartz.CoreGraphics**: Used for accessing low-level, system-wide input states in MacOS.

## Features
- **Real-time Caps Lock status**: Instantly know whether Caps Lock is on or off by glancing at your menu bar.
- **Minimalist design**: Uses simple, color-coded indicators to show the status of Caps Lock.

## Usage
To use the Caps Lock Indicator, simply run the application. It will sit quietly in the menu bar and update the status icon based on the state of your Caps Lock key.

## Future Development
- **Background Operation**: Plan to enhance the application to run as a background service without a terminal window.
- **Configurable Settings**: Explore adding options to customize the appearance and behavior of the indicator.

## Version
- **Version 1**: Initial release with basic functionality to monitor and display Caps Lock status.
